A Guide to Forecasting Bitcoin (BTC) Prices using RNNs

Introduction to Time Series Forecasting:

Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape, and Bitcoin (BTC) remains at the forefront of this digital revolution. With its price volatility, Bitcoin has garnered significant attention from investors and traders seeking to make profits. One popular approach to predict BTC price movements is through Time Series Forecasting. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to forecast BTC prices based on past data.

Explanation of Preprocessing Method:

Before building the forecasting model, we need to preprocess the raw data from the coinbase and bitstamp datasets. The preprocessing involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning: We remove unnecessary data points such as timestamps, volume, and transaction amounts, as they do not directly contribute to predicting prices.

Data Normalization: Normalizing the data to a [0, 1] range ensures that all features are on the same scale. This is crucial for faster convergence during model training.

Sequence Creation: To train the RNN model, we create sequences of data points. Each sequence represents the past 24 hours of BTC data, and the target is the BTC price at the close of the following hour.

By preprocessing the data in this manner, we eliminate noise and facilitate the model's ability to identify meaningful patterns in the time series data.

Setting up tf.data.Dataset:

TensorFlow's tf.data.Dataset is an efficient way to handle data during training. We split the preprocessed data into training and validation sets. The tf.data.Dataset API allows us to perform batching, shuffling, and other data transformations easily. It helps in optimizing memory usage and enhances the model's training process.

Explanation of the Model Architecture:

For our BTC price forecasting, we employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as our RNN architecture. LSTMs are well-suited for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data. The LSTM layer is followed by a dense output layer with a single unit to predict the BTC price for the next hour.

The LSTM layer's internal memory mechanism allows the model to remember relevant information from previous time steps and use it to make informed predictions about future BTC prices.


<Code Example>
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def create_rnn_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    return model

# Compile the model and specify the loss function and optimizer.


Results and Performance:

After training the model on the preprocessed data, we evaluate its performance on the validation set. 

Examples:

Suppose we have the following preprocessed data sequence representing BTC prices for five consecutive hours:

Open Price	High Price	Low Price	Close Price
0.20	0.30	0.15	0.25
0.25	0.35	0.20	0.30
0.30	0.40	0.25	0.35
0.35	0.45	0.30	0.40
0.40	0.50	0.35	0.45
Given this sequence, the model predicts the BTC price for the next hour, which would be 0.50 in this case.

The model makes predictions based on the patterns and trends it learns from the historical data, enabling it to forecast future BTC prices with increasing accuracy as it is trained on more data.

Model Performance

We analyze the performance using mean squared error (MSE) and other relevant error metrics. The lower the MSE value, the better the model's ability to make accurate predictions. While our model can provide insights into price trends, it is essential to remember that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and influenced by various external factors.

Conclusion and Thoughts on Forecasting BTC:

In conclusion, Time Series Forecasting using RNNs offers an intriguing approach to predicting BTC prices. The process of preprocessing data, setting up tf.data.Dataset, and designing the LSTM model requires careful consideration to achieve accurate predictions.

However, forecasting BTC prices remains a challenging task due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. External factors like market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic events can have a significant impact on BTC prices. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution and not solely rely on predictive models for investment decisions.
